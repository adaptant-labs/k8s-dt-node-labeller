# Device Tree Kubernetes Node Labeller

This tool provides a custom Kubernetes controller for automatically labelling nodes with [devicetree] properties.

It is inspired by and re-uses much of the Kubernetes controller plumbing from the [amdgpu-node-labeller].

## Use Cases

`k8s-dt-node-labeller` was developed in order to facilitate targeted deployments into hybrid (e.g. armhf, arm64)
Kubernetes clusters, as well as for targeting heterogeneous accelerators in Edge deployments.

## Usage

The node labeller is further expected to be run node-local, and will need to be invoked on each individual node
requiring its own specific devicetree parsing and labelling.

By default, `compatible` strings from the top-level `/` node are discovered and converted to node labels.

```
$ k8s-dt-node-labeller
Discovered the following devicetree properties:

beta.devicetree.org/nvidia-jetson-nano: 1
beta.devicetree.org/nvidia-tegra210: 1
```

additional node specifications are possible via the `-n` flag, as below:

```
$ k8s-dt-node-labeller -n gpu pwm-fan
Discovered the following devicetree properties:

beta.devicetree.org/nvidia-jetson-nano: 1
beta.devicetree.org/nvidia-tegra210: 1
beta.devicetree.org/nvidia-tegra210-gm20b: 1
beta.devicetree.org/nvidia-gm20b: 1
beta.devicetree.org/pwm-fan: 1
```
